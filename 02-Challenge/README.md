Project title: Challenge-1

Usage: In my challenge I cleaned up my code by shortening it slightly, reviewing the html code and making it neater. I gave it a concise title that matches the website. I made sure that nothing was affected by my slight changes to the HTML code.

Features: I shortened the code for optimization, and is slightly easier to read. A fully accessible website with a nothing else that has affected the code.
